{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq1}

It is strongly advised that you update DataStage to the most recent version so that you can take advantage of external tables to load your data into {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}.
{: important}

If you don’t already have a data server client installed, download and install the IBM Data Server Client <!--Version 10.5 -->that is appropriate for your client machine’s operating system: [IBM Data Server Client](https://www.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=swg-idsc97){:external}.

To make connections with the SSL protocol, download and install the 32-bit GSKit V8. Click the OS tab that is appropriate for your client machine’s operating system: [GSKit V8 - Install, Uninstall and Upgrade instructions](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21631462){:external}. For the following operating systems, ensure that you add the GSKit installation directory path to the OS-specific path environment variable:

- AIX®: **LIBPATH**
   - `/usr/opt/ibm/gsk8/lib`
- Linux: **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**
    - `/usr/local/ibm/gsk8/lib`
- UNIX: **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**
    - `/opt/ibm/gsk8/lib`
- Windows: **PATH**
    - `<installation_directory>\gsk8\bin`
    - `<installation_directory>\gsk8\lib`

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database, verify that you have the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/services/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-connect_ov#prereqs).

### Procedure
{: #proc1}

- To create a connection with SSL, complete the following steps:

  1. Open a command line or terminal and make a new directory in the DataStage system to store the SSL certificate and key files.

     `# /home/db2inst2> mkdir SSL`

     `# /home/db2inst2> cd SSL`

  2. In the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} web console, download the SSL certificate from the **Connect your applications to the database** page.

     a. From the main menu, click **Connect**.
     
     b. Click **Connection with SSL**, and then click the **SSL certificate (1 KB)** link.
     
     c. Save the `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt` certificate into the SSL directory that you made in step 1.
        
  3. Create a client keystore database in the DataStage system by using the **gsk8capicmd_64** utility.

     `# /home/db2inst2/SSL> gsk8capicmd_64 -keydb -create -db <keystore_db.kdb> -pw <ks_db_password> -stash`

     where `<keystore_db.kdb>` represents the client keystore database and `<ks_db_password>` represents the password for the client keystore database.
        
  4. Add the certificate to the client keystore database.

     `# /home/db2inst2/SSL> gsk8capicmd_64 -cert -add -db <keystore_db.kdb> -pw <ks_db_password> -label BLUDB_SSL -file DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt`

     where `<keystore_db.kdb>` represents the client keystore database and `<ks_db_password>` represents the password for the client keystore database.
    
  5. Configure the Db2 client on the DataStage server.
            
     a. Update the SSL configuration parameters in the database manager.

     `# /home/db2inst2> db2 update dbm cfg using SSL_CLNT_KEYDB /home/db2inst2/SSL/<keystore_db.kdb>`

     where `<keystore_db.kdb>` represents the client keystore database.

     `# /home/db2inst2> db2 update dbm cfg using SSL_CLNT_STASH /home/db2inst2/SSL/<keystore_db.sth>`

     where `<keystore_db.sth>` represents the client keystore database password stash.
            
     b. Catalog the target node with the SSL security option and then the BLUDB database at that target node.

     `# /home/db2inst2> db2 catalog tcpip node <node_name> remote <IP_addr_of_BLUDB_database_server> server 50001 security SSL`

     where `<node_name>` represents your name for the target node and `<IP_addr_of_BLUDB_database_server>` represents the IP address of the BLUDB database server,

     `# /home/db2inst2> db2 catalog db BLUDB as <db_alias> at node <node_name>`

     where `<db_alias>` is your name for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database.

  6. Add read and execute permissions on the files in the SSL directory for everyone. The DataStage user who runs the jobs needs to access these files to make SSL connections to the Db2 database.

     `# /home/db2inst2/SSL> chmod 655 /home/db2inst2/SSL/*`

  7. Test the SSL connection in one of the following ways:

     - Test the connection by using CLP. Issue the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

       `db2 connect to <db_alias> user <user_id>`

       where `<db_alias>` is your name for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database and `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID. You are prompted to enter your password.
    
     - Test the connection by using CLI. Issue the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

       `db2cli validate -dsn <alias> -connect -user <user_id> -passwd <password>`

        where `<alias>` is an alias that you created by using the **db2cli writecfg** command, `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID, and `<password>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} password.

- To create a connection without SSL, catalog the target {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database by completing the following steps:

  1. Catalog the target {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} node so that client applications can connect to it. Run the following CLP commands:

     `db2 catalog tcpip node <node_name> remote <IP_address_of_BLUDB_database_server> server <port_number_of_BLUDB_database>`

     where `<node_name>` represents your name for the node, `<IP_address_of_BLUDB_database_server>` represents the IP address of the BLUDB database server, and `<port_number_of_BLUDB_database>` represents the port number of the BLUDB database.

  2. Catalog the remote {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database so that client applications can connect to it. Run the following command:

     `db2 catalog db BLUDB as <db_alias> at node <node_name>`

     where `<db_alias>` represents your name for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database and `<node_name>` represents your name for the node.

  3. Test the non-SSL connection in one of the following ways:

      - Test the connection by using CLP. Issue the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

        `db2 connect to <db_alias> user <user_id>`

        where `<db_alias>` is your name for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database and `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID. You are prompted to enter your password.

        `db2 list tables`

      - Test the connection by using CLI. Issue the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

        `db2cli validate -dsn <alias> -connect -user <user_id> -passwd <password>`

        where `<alias>` is an alias that you created by using the **db2cli writecfg** command, `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID, and `<password>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} password.

  4. Use the [connection information](/docs/services/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-db_details_cxn_creds#db_details_cxn_creds) that you collected beforehand to define a connection in the DataStage client. On the **Parameters** tab, you must select the **DB2 Connector** for the **Connect using Staging Type** field.

## InfoSphere Data Replication
{: #idr}

You can connect IBM® InfoSphere® Data Replication <!--version 11.3.3.3-36 or later -->to a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database. This capability applies to both SMP and MPP environments. It does not apply to the Entry plan of {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}. 
{: shortdesc}

### Overview
{: #overview2}

Ideally, when you connect IBM InfoSphere Data Replication to {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}, IBM InfoSphere Data Replication is in the same {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Data Center as {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} or is colocated with {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}. IBM InfoSphere Data Replication connects from a local server to the remote {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} instance.

When you use {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} as a connection target, the performance of IBM InfoSphere Data Replication partly depends on the bandwidth of the network that separates its target engine from the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} instance. Physical distance also affects performance: ideally, IBM InfoSphere Data Replication is as close as possible to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} instance. Network topology also affects performance. For example, ideally, the IBM InfoSphere Data Replication target engine runs on a VM in the same VPN (security domain) as the target instance. The fewer the network nodes (for example, firewalls or routers) to traverse, the better. 

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq2}

If you intend to connect by using the SSL protocol, download and install GSKit V8. See [GSKit V8 - Install, Uninstall and Upgrade instructions](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21631462){:external}. Click the operating system tab that applies to your client machine’s operating system. If you are installing the GSKit on a Windows computer, ensure that you specify the GSKit installation directory path (`<installation_directory>\gsk8\bin`) for the **`PATH`** environment variable.

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database, verify that you have the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/services/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-connect_ov#prereqs).

If you intend to connect by using the SSL protocol, download the `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt` SSL certificate from the web console to a directory on the client machine. To download the certificate, click **Connection > Connection Information** and then click the **Connection with SSL** tab.

### Procedure
{: #proc2}

1. Choose one of the following approaches to make your connection:

   - To create a connection with SSL, complete the following steps:
            
     a. Issue the following command:

     `cd /<ssl_directory_name>/ssl`

     where `/<ssl_directory_name>/ssl` is the path to the directory into which you downloaded the `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt` SSL certificate.

     b. Create a client key database and a stash file by using the **GSKCapiCmd** tool. For example, the following command creates a client key database called `dashclient.kdb` and a stash file called `dashclient.sth`:

     `gsk8capicmd_64 -keydb -create -db "dashclient.kdb" -pw "passw0rdpw0" -stash`

     where `passw0rdpw0` is a password. The **-stash** option creates a stash file in the same path as that of the client key database, with a file extension of `.sth`. At connection time, GSKit uses the stash file to obtain the password to the client key database.
            
     c. Add the certificate to the client key database. For example, the following **gsk8capicmd** command imports the certificate from the `/<ssl_directory_name>/ssl/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt` file into the client key database called `dashclient.kdb`:

     `gsk8capicmd_64 -cert -add -db "dashclient.kdb" -pw "passw0rdpw0" -label "DigiCert" -file "/<ssl_directory_name>/ssl/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt" -format ascii -fips`

     d. Update the values of the `SSL_CLNT_KEYDB` and `SSL_CLNT_STASH` database manager configuration parameters on the client to specify the client key database and the stash file. Examples follow:

     `db2 update dbm cfg using SSL_CLNT_KEYDB /<ssl_directory_name>/ssl/dashclient.kdb`

     `db2 update dbm cfg using SSL_CLNT_STASH /<ssl_directory_name>/ssl/dashclient.sth`

     e. Catalog the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} node so that client applications can connect to it. Issue the following command:

     `db2 catalog tcpip node <node_name> remote <Db2_Warehouse_IP_address> server <port_number> security ssl`

     where:
                
     `<node_name>` is your name for the node.

     `<Db2_Warehouse_IP_address>` is the IP address of the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} server.

     `<port_number>` is the port that is used to connect to {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} by using an SSL connection. If you are using the default port, specify `50001`.
            
     f. Catalog the remote {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database so that client applications can connect to it. Issue the following command:

     `db2 catalog database bludb as <db_alias> at node <node_name>`

     where `db_alias` is your name for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database.
            
     g. Test the SSL connection in one of the following ways:
                
     - Test the connection using CLP by issuing the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

       `db2 connect to <db_alias> user <user_id>`

       where `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID. You are prompted to enter your password.
                
     - Test the connection using CLI by issuing the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

       `db2cli validate -dsn <alias> -connect -user <user_id> -passwd <password>`

       where `<alias>` is a DSN alias that you created by using the **db2cli writecfg** command, `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID, and `<password>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database password.
        
   - To create a connection without SSL, complete the following steps:

     a. Catalog the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} node so that client applications can connect to it. Issue the following command:

     `db2 catalog tcpip node <node_name> remote <Db2_Warehouse_IP_address> server <port_number>`

     where:
                
     `<node_name>` is your name for the node.

     `<Db2_Warehouse_IP_address>` is the IP address of the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} server.

     `<port_number>` is the port that is used to connect to {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} without using an SSL connection. If you are using the default port, specify `50000`.
            
     b. Catalog the remote {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database so that client applications can connect to it. Issue the following command:

     `db2 catalog database bludb as <db_alias> at node <node_name>`

     where `<db_alias>` is your name for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database.

     c. Test the non-SSL connection in one of the following ways:

     - Test the connection using CLP by issuing the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

       `db2 connect to <db_alias> user <user_id>`

       where `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID. You are prompted to enter your password.
                
     - Test the connection using CLI by issuing the following command to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database:

       `db2cli validate -dsn <alias> -connect -user <user_id> -passwd <password>`

       where `<alias>` is a DSN alias that you created by using the **db2cli writecfg** command, `<user_id>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} user ID, and `<password>` is your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} password.
    
2. Launch the InfoSphere Data Replication configuration tool and perform the following steps. The values that are shown in the screen captures are examples.
        
   a. Add a source instance to point to your source database by using the **Instance Configuration** tab:

   ![IIDR New Instance - Source instance](images/IIDR_source_instance.jpg "Source instance configuration"){: caption="Figure 1. IIDR New Instance - Source instance" caption-side="bottom"}

   b. Add a target instance to point to your target Db2 database by using the **Instance Configuration** tab. If you are not using IBM InfoSphere Data Replication 11.3.3.3-50 or later, do not select the **Specify refresh loader path** check box.

   ![IIDR New Instance - Target instance](images/IIDR_target_instance.jpg "Target instance configuration"){: caption="Figure 2. IIDR New Instance - Target instance" caption-side="bottom"}

   c. Start each instance:

   ![IIDR Configuration Tool](images/IIDR_instances.jpg "IIDR Configuration Tool listing source and target instances"){: caption="Figure 3. IIDR Configuration Tool" caption-side="bottom"}

3. Launch the InfoSphere Data Replication management console and use Access Manager to complete the following steps:
        
   a. Create a datastore to connect to your source instance by using the **Datastore** tab. Because a Db2 database was not originally supported as a source database, you must provide user and password information for the source database by clicking **Connection Parameters**.

   ![Datastore Properties - Source](images/IIDR_source_datastore.jpg "Source datastore properties"){: caption="Figure 4. View of source datastore properties" caption-side="bottom"}

   b. Create a datastore to connect to your target instance by using the **Datastore** tab. You must provide user and password information by clicking **Connection Parameters**.

## CLPPlus
{: #clpplus}

Command line processor plus (CLPPlus) is included in the Db2 driver package. CLPPlus provides a command-line interface that you can use to connect to a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database. You can use CLPPlus to define, edit, and run statements, scripts, and commands.
{: shortdesc}

### Prerequisites
{: #prereq7}

Before attempting to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database, verify that you have the necessary [prerequisites](/docs/services/Db2onCloud/connecting?topic=Db2onCloud-connect_ov#prereqs).

To use CLPPlus, ensure that a software development kit (SDK) or a Java runtime environment (JRE) for Java Version 1.5.0 or later is installed on your computer and that environment variables are set as follows:

- The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the Java installation directory on your computer.
- The `PATH` environment variable setting includes the `bin` subdirectory of the Java installation directory on your computer.

### Procedure
{: #proc7}

1. In a command shell on Linux operating systems, at the Windows command prompt, or in the DB2 command window on Windows operating systems, run the following commands:

   These commands create new entries in the driver configuration file (`db2dsdriver.cfg`) on your computer and set the connection attributes. You need to do this step only one time.

   - For a connection with SSL:

     `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50001 -parameter "SecurityTransportMode=SSL"`

     `db2cli writecfg add -dsn <alias> -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50001`  

     where:
     
     - `<hostname>` is the host name of the server.
     - `<alias>` is an alias that you choose.

   - For a connection without SSL:

     `db2cli writecfg add -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50000`

     `db2cli writecfg add -dsn <alias> -database BLUDB -host <hostname> -port 50000`

2. To start CLPPlus with a connection to a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} database that uses the entries in the `db2dsdriver.cfg` file, run the following command:

   - Windows environments: 

     `clpplus <userid>@<alias>`

   - Linux environments:

     `clpplus -nw <userid>@<alias>`

     where:
     
     - `<userid>` is the user ID from the connect credentials you collected beforehand.
     - `<alias>` is the alias that you created with the **db2cli writecfg** command.

   Running this command opens a CLPPlus window.

3. In the CLPPlus window, enter your password. The database information is displayed, followed by an SQL prompt. Sample output follows:

```
   Hostname = 192.0.2.0
   Database server = DB2/LINUXX8664  SQL10054
   SQL authorization ID = smith
   Local database alias = BLUDB
   Port = 50001
   
   SQL>
```

### Results
{: #results7}

You can now enter CLPPlus commands or SELECT statements and run scripts to work with the data in the database.

### Examples

The following examples use a short script that retrieves rows from the sample table `GOSALES.BRANCH`. The script file is named `cities.sql` and is on the local Windows computer in the `C:\temp directory`. The `cities.sql` file contains the following text:

```
SET ECHO ON
SELECT branch_code, city from GOSALES.BRANCH;
```

#### Example 1 

To run the script interactively:

1. Start CLPPlus with your user ID and the alias that you created in the `db2dsdriver.cfg` file by running the following command:

   `clpplus <user_id>@<alias>`
2. Enter your password.
3. At the SQL prompt, enter the following text:

   `start C:\temp\cities.sql`

#### Example 2

Start CLPPlus with your user ID and the alias that you created in the `db2dsdriver.cfg` file and run the script in one step:

`clpplus <user_id>/<password>@<alias> @C:\temp\cities.sql`

Sample output from the `cities.sql` script follows:
