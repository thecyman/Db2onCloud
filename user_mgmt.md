# Managing users
{: #user_mgmt}

Management of users that were given access to the database is the sole responsibility of the user or users with the administrator role. The administrator has the responsibility to manage how other users in your organization access your database.
{: shortdesc}

The database administrator role manages the following types of user access: 
* Web console. From the web console, users can run queries against the database.
* Database. The administrator can grant granular access permissions to the database, including only being able to access certain tables, schemas, or even rows or columns.
