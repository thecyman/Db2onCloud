# Free Lite plan
{: #free_plan}

The {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} free Lite plan provides basic resources to let you develop or learn about Db2 without charge.
{: shortdesc}

There is no time limit on the free plan, but users must re-extend their free plan every 30 days.

Only community support is available. 
 
## Architecture
{: #architecture}

Unlike other {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} plans, the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} free Lite plan runs on a multi-tenant system. The Flex and Precise Performance plans run on their own single-tenant virtual machines or baremetal servers.
 
The free plan allows you to use one database schema.

For more information about the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} free Lite plan, see the [FAQ ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://ibm.biz/db2oc_free_plan_faq){:new_window}.

## Using the Lite plan outside continental North America and Europe
{: #outside_na}

The free Lite plan is currently accessible without a credit card for Europe and continental North America. Outside of continental Europe and North America, customers must add a credit card to their IBM Cloud account and then select the "US South - Dallas" or "London" region for the free Lite plan to be visible for selection.

The Lite plan is always free and your credit card will not be charged.
