# Free Lite plan
{: #free_plan}

The {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} Lite plan provides basic resources for you to develop or learn about Db2 without charge.
{: shortdesc}

There is no time limit on the Lite plan, but users must re-extend their Lite plan every 30 days.

Only community support is available. 
 
## Architecture
{: #architecture}

Unlike other {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} plans, the free {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} Lite plan runs on a multi-tenant system. The Flex and Precise Performance plans run on their own single-tenant virtual machines or bare metal servers.
 
The Lite plan uses one database schema.

For more information about the free {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} Lite plan, see the [FAQ](https://ibm.biz/db2oc_free_plan_faq){:external}.

## Using the Lite plan outside continental North America
{: #outside_na}

The Lite plan is accessible without a credit card for continental North America. Outside of continental North America, customers must add a credit card to their IBM Cloud account and then select the "US South - Dallas" region for the Lite plan to be visible for selection.

The Lite plan is always free and your credit card will not be charged.
